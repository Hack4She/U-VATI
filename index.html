        <b>As a young girl, Malala Yousafzai defied the Taliban in Pakistan and demanded 
        that girls should be allowed to receive education. She was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman 
        in 2012 but survived. In 2014, she became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
        Who Is Malala Yousafzai?
       Malala Yousafzai is a Pakistani education advocate who, at the age of 17 in 2014, 
        became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize after surviving an assassination 
        attempt by the Taliban.
        Yousafzai became an advocate for girls' education when she herself 
        was still a child, which resulted in the Taliban issuing a death threat against her. 
       On October 9, 2012, a gunman shot Yousafzai when she was traveling home from school. 
        She survived and has continued to speak out on the importance of education. 
        In 2013, she gave a 
        speech to the United Nations and published her first book, I Am Malala.</b></div>

    <div class="desc"><b>Arunima Sinha is the first female amputee to climb Mount Everest. She was a 
        national level volleyball player who in 2011, aged just 24, was thrown from a moving train by
         some thugs for refusing to hand over the gold chain she was wearing. She was run over by a 
         passing train and her resulting injuries led to her leg being amputated below the knee.
        It was while still being treated in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, that Arunima 
        resolved to climb Mount Everest. She was deeply inspired by the cricketer, Yuvraj Singh, 
        who had successfully battled cancer and she resolved to do something with her life. She excelled 
        in the basic mountaineering course from the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, Uttarkashi. 
        This was followed by 18 months of rigorous training.  On 21st May 2013, Arunima reached the summit 
        of Everest as part of the Tata Group Sponsored Eco Everest Expedition, becoming the first female 
        amputee to scale the famous mountain.
         Her dream is to climb the highest peaks in each continent around the world. She has so far scaled 
         Everest in Asia, Kilimanjaro in Africa, Elbrus in Europe, Kosciuszko in Australia and Aconcagua 
         in South America.
        Arunima Sinha currently runs a non-profit school for underprivileged handicapped children.
         In 2014, Arunima’s book, ‘Born Again on the Mountain’ was published, the launch was attended by 
         the Prime Minister of India, Narenda Modi.
         In 2015, she was awarded Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award in India.
